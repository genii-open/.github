Launched in celebration of the 100-year anniversary of EEG, this initiative is dedicated to making EEG/ESI accessible for all.

The project was planned in early 2024, with development beginning on 21 May 2024 (the birthdate of Hans Berger, the pioneer of EEG). It was officially announced and open-sourced on 6 September 2024, and has since been actively supporting clinicians in epilepsy diagnosis at the Universiti Malaya Medical Center.
