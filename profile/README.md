### General Electrophysiological Neuro-Interface & Intelligence (GENII)
The project **(GENII: EEG & Source Imaging on Cloud with AI)** was planned in early 2024, with development beginning on 21 May 2024 (the birthday of **Hans Berger, the inventor of EEG**, recognizing his groundbreaking contributions during **the 100th year since the discovery of EEG**). It was **officially announced and open-sourced on 6 September 2024**, and has since been actively supporting clinicians in epilepsy diagnosis at the Universiti Malaya Medical Center.
<br/><br/>

### Mission

Our mission is to revolutionize epilepsy diagnosis and brain research by harnessing the power of AI and cloud-based EEG with source imaging, while embracing the open-source philosophy to make advanced tools accessible to all.

### Vision

We envision becoming a key enabler for a future where AI and cloud computing are seamlessly integrated into clinical practice, driving personalized, data-driven care for patients with neurological conditions.
